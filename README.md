# Happy Coloring Book
‚úèÔ∏èüé® Coloring book application for *every* system where Java SE is available.

## Description
Work in progress. Very similiar application like in my xmas-colorbook repository.

Some important things to notice:
* Application currently does not offer any builded-in images to coloring - I am planning to make some few in future,
but for now you must download some nice images to coloring for your own.
* If you are curious where it make its autosave - look for ".HappyColoring" directory in your user home dir (just
you must enable "show hidden files" in your file manager). Yes, I know most of people here would thinked this
very fast, but I also know some who was a bit confused.
* Yes this program can easily get foolished if you use two or more images with exactly the same name (even when they are
in separate directories). Maybe it is a bad idea to make such autosave feature, but for now it simply works like that and
simply look at names of your coloring images - rename one if you have problems.
* Mouse wheel works as a darkening or lightening current color.
* Right mouse button works as a pipette tool - right click to get color from place under cursor.
* Application currently have two language versions - english and polish (and they are not 100% finished yet).
